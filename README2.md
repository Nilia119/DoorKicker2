# DoorKicker2
Collection of my DooKicker2 Mods

You have to manually Copy the corresponding Modfolder e.g. NIlia_KSK (For the German KSK Mod) from the Downloaded .zip archive to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\KillHouseGames\DoorKickers2\mods
As an unzipped folder.

To Use the new Unit ingame, you have to firstly add the new Squad ingame under Squads -> (where you can browse for your squads) there is a little diamond with a "plus" in it
above the "back" button.

There Browse to "KSK" and click add.
